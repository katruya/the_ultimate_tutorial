# Use of these files...
is unrestricted! Play to your heart's content.
In the Sandbox, you can make what you want.
The purpose of the sandbox is for experimentation
and applying what you learn.

IT IS VITAL THAT YOU PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!
A good way to practice is to just do what I like to 
call the method of FAFO - F*** Around & Find Out.
I've found that I learn so much more by trying new
things with the concepts I am exposed to.

## Some Starting Points... to Get You Started

1. Modify this code as you desire
```javascript
(function() {
    let theWords = 'Hola, Mundo!';
    console.log(theWords);
})();
```
2. The following HTML is given
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">
    </div>
    <script src="sandbox.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
Use your sandbox.js to target the div element with id "app"
and GO HAM!
3. Modify this code to do cool things
```javascript
(function() {
    const coolThings = function() {
        return "Cool things were done";
    }
    console.log(coolThings());
})();
```
4. Add to and/or change this Car class to make a better Car!
```javascript
class Car {
    constructor(make, model, color) {
        this.isRunning = false;
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color
    }
    
    isRunning() {
        return this.isRunning;
    }

    getMake() {
        return this.make;
    }

    getModel() {
        return this.model;
    }

    getColor() {
        return this.color;
    }
};
```
5. The following CSS is given
```css
#app {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
}
```
Use this CSS in sand_style.css as a starting point for an app!
