In these first lessons, there is no prior knowledge assumed.
In fact, there is no designing, coding, or command line work here.
All you have to do is humor me by reading this section in full if you
are not familiar with some of these concepts. 
If you are uninterested and impatient, you are free to move on to the code.
However, concepts and terms learned here WILL be used throughout the rest
of the course. I urge you to be patient and *READ ACTIVELY*.

Let's begin...

Indeed, you are about to embark upon a grand journey into a new field. This field
is rich, complex, and life-changing. You may find yourself struggling at times. Remember in that moment: *strength before weakness*. Do not give up! Just because
you haven't mastered everything in this tutorial, that doesn't mean you are not 
fully capable of learning through consistent and regular practice.
